i do plan on updating this code. I doubt anyone will use it for a while but if by some chance
you are using it before i update it this is just a heads up that itll be getting updated.

Thanks to decryptionite for some help @decryptionite on discord

(run the install.bat and it will install "requests" this is mandatory for running the py file)
